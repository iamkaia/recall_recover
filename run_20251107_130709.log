torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 20.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.64 GiB of which 50.00 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 12.81 GiB memory in use. Process 2520218 has 9.76 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.86 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 532.28 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.

`` the time machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .
cool ?
it 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .
my thoughts were focused on the characters .
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
affleck and jackson are good sparring partners .
not exactly the bees knees
the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough .
it 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
a tender , heartfelt family drama .
there is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
it 's like watching a nightmare made flesh .
rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .
pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins .
a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie .
it 's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part .
it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot .
like leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable .
and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
the film 's performances are thrilling .
